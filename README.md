# Little Testing Program for PID

This repo is my little testing site for learning 
how to use PID to turn and move the robot. The end
goal being that hopefully I will be able to accurately
turn the robot with minimal problems.

Resources: 
* [Renegade Robotics PID guide](https://renegaderobotics.org/pid-beginners-guide/) - This resource is fantastic!
